The Procrastination Equation

Piers Steel, PhD

1. For example, successfully making your bed in the morning can propel you to get more things done. If you don't have the confidence that you can accomplish something, you may not want to waste calories trying. Similarly, if you haven't achieved something recently, how do you know you can accomplish this new goal? You don't have any momentum.

2. Think of dominoes. Knocking over the first domino uses the power of compounding to knock down other dominoes, and you only need to focus on knocking over that first domino.

3. Plan your day the night before.

Decide what you will accomplish first the next day.

Begin your day by doing something meaningful before other activities creep in.

Make a checklist and cross items off the list as you complete the tasks.

Reminding yourself of your wins helps you build momentum.

4. Besides eliminating distractions, pick a specific goal and a specific time frame when you will work without distractions.

5. Set up a sleep routine.

Pick a specific time when you need to be in bed and have a pre-bed ritual that can calm your nervous system, like drinking tea, reading a book, or meditating. Going to bed directly from work may make it difficult for you to sleep. Also, create a good sleep environment by turning off the lights, using dark curtains, or playing slow music.

6. Study yourself to know whether you're most active early in the morning or are a night owl. Put your most important tasks a few hours after you wake up because that's when you're likely to be most efficient. A brief nap during the day can also extend your efficiency phase. If you cannot nap during the day, take a walk during lunchtime.

7. If a goal seems hard to achieve, find a portion of it you can tackle.
